# Contributor Guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing to Sophie! Following these guidelines will make the collaborative process easier for maintainers and other contributors, alike.


## Issues
Although we don't want to slow you down in filing that urgent bug request or feature, just a quick glance at this section will help your issue fit in and easier to scan for those used to our organization system.

We have templates for Bug Reports and Feature Requests to get you started easily.

### Issue Titles
Prefix with one of:
- `SE:` - for standard development and engineering roadmap of building Sophie.
- `Bug:` - for bug reports.
- `Feature:` - for feature requests and enhancements (usually smaller than and exits the normal operations of `SE`)
- `Build:` - for anything related to our ancilliary CI/GitHub Actions/Build systems.
- `Docs:` - for documentation.

### Issue Content
For Bug Reports and Feature Requests, the template should help you out.

For the other types of issues, use headings (except H1), lists, and try to resemble existing issues representing excellent organization.


## Pull Requests
We welcome pull requests and would love to have you help! To make things easier for contributors, we have a pre-contribution checklist, commit format, and a pull request template to help make sure your contribution is relevant and your pull request gets merged.

Before we get to all of that, here's a legal primer:

### Copyright & License
Sophie is licensed under the well-accepted Apache 2.0 license. All contributions must be made under this license or as public domain dedications (such as CC0, Unlicense, or even "Public Domain.").

### Commit Message Format
As for now, we only require that your message begins with one of the prefixes in the [Pull Request Titles](#Pull-Request-Titles) section. Populate the extended message, as well, using a bullet-form concise summary if multiple things changed, or a sentence for smaller, direct changes.

### Pre-Contribution Checklist
Before you start writing code/a contribution, here's something to help your first steps to go in the right direction:

- [ ] Issue exists on the issue tracker for the problem I am solving (if not, consider making one).
- [ ] Post a message on the issue thread: get more information or just give a heads-up that you want to tackle this problem.

### Pull Request Titles
Prefix with one of:
- `SE:` - for standard development and engineering roadmap of building Sophie.
- `Bug:` - for bug reports.
- `Feature:` - for feature requests and enhancements (usually smaller than, and exit the normal operations of, `SE`)
- `Build:` - for anything related to our ancilliary CI/GitHub Actions/Build systems.
- `Docs:` - for documentation.

### Pull Request Content
Follow the template and add more secondary headings if needed (for media or call-outs, for example).  

You can also check the box to allow maintainers to edit your pull requests. It will help improve organization if it gets out of line (unconformant titles, template dashed out the window, etc).
